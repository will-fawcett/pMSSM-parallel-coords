# pMSSM parallel coordinates
- Contained in this repository is sufficient code to re-create the webpage hosted here: http://www-pnp.physics.ox.ac.uk/~fawcett/pmssm.html
- The code makes heavy use of the open-source D3 software: https://d3js.org/, which is excellent for displaying data in visually impressive formats.

## Information about what is on the website
- The webpage dispalys a parallel coordinates plot of several points in the pMSSM parameter space that were selected for this paper, [JHEP 10 (2015) 134](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FJHEP10%282015%29134) wherein more information about the pMSSM can be found. 
- The pMSSM is a 19 parameter subset of the larger MSSM.
- Each line corresponds to a point in this 19 dimensional space, and represents a different theoretical model of beyond-the-standard model physics.
- Each axis corresponds to either one of these 19 parameters, or some other calculable observable about the theory that is of some interest.
